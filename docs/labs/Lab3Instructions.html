<h1 id="lab-3-generating-reports-with-r-markdown">Lab 3: Generating Reports with R Markdown</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab we learn how to integrate R code and text into a single report. We use the RMarkdown file format for this (<code>.Rmd</code>), which has many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The R code that produces our results is incorporated into our report. This way our results can be reproduced very easily.</li>
<li>We can work within the RStudio application, without the need for a separate text editing application.</li>
<li>The RMarkdown document can easily produce different outputs, e.g. PDF, Web pages, Word documents.</li>
<li>RMarkdown is built atop of Markdown, which is a very popular formatting standard for creating structured plain text documents. You can learn more about RMarkdown at the following link: <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overall-goals">Overall Goals</h2>
<p>In this lab we will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a basic RMarkdown document</li>
<li>add code, results and graphics into the document</li>
<li>create structural elements like sections, quoted and highlighted parts</li>
<li>export the RMarkdown document to various formats</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time we will get a chance to practice the R commands we learned in the previous labs.</p>
<p>New R commands introduced in this lab: <code>sum</code>, <code>panel.abline</code>, <code>ladd</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-rstudio-project">Creating an RStudio Project</h2>
<p>RStudio projects allow us to organize our work. A project is essentially a folder/directory of related files. You can easily start a new project or download someone else’s project to start.</p>
<p>We have created a starting project for you. In order to set it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>In RStudio, go to <code>File &gt; New Project</code>. Choose “Version Control” from the “Create Project” dialog.</li>
<li><p>Choose “Git” and then enter the following URL into the “Repository URL” field. Either type the URL by hand (no spaces) or copy it from the HTML version.</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/HanoverStatsLabs/Lab-Intro-RMarkdown</code></pre></li>
<li>Enter a name for the project directory. <code>Lab_3_yourname</code> might be a reasonable choice.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to display a list of all the folders in your home directory on vault.</li>
<li>We will now create a parent folder to hold all of your lab assignments for this class. Click the <strong>New Folder</strong> button (lower left) and name your new folder something appropriate, like <code>Math217Labs</code>. Click <strong>Choose</strong> (lower right) to make this the parent folder for Lab 3.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Create Project</strong> to finalize the setup process.</li>
<li><p>In future labs, of course, you don’t need to create a new parent folder, just use the Browse button to select Math217Labs as the parent folder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If all has gone well, you should now see the project files in the <strong>Files pane</strong> at the bottom right of RStudio.</p>
<p>The file we are interested in is called <code>Lab3Report.Rmd</code>. Click on it to open it up for editing. It should appear at the top left of the application window. We will work on this file in the subsequent sections.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-rmarkdown-documents">Working with RMarkdown Documents</h2>
<p>RMarkdown documents typically start with a <em>header</em> section. In it you get to specify title, author and date for the report, as well as some other technical settings that we will not worry about right now. Take a moment to add your own information in the header fields. Make sure to save your edits (File &gt; Save) before proceeding.</p>
<p>The rest of the RMarkdown document will contain the actual contents of your report.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-an-rmarkdown-document">Exporting an RMarkdown Document</h3>
<p>Exporting an RMarkdown document into other formats is called <strong>Knitting</strong>. You will find a <strong>Knit</strong> pulldown at the top of the editing pane. Use the arrow to its right to select an output format.</p>
<p>DO NOW: Use <strong>Knit to HTML</strong> to create a compiled version of the report. You will need to do this frequently as you work on your report.</p>
<p>If everything is in order you should see the output of your report so far. Make sure you have added your own title, name and date information to the header.</p>
<h3 id="completing-the-lab">Completing the Lab</h3>
<p>The first section of the Lab 3 report is designed to introduce the main structures used in RMarkdown. For example, you learn how to make boldfaced text, section headings, numbered lists, bulleted lists, and so on.</p>
<p>DO NOW: Take a few minutes to compare the text in the RMarkdown window with the corresponding HTML output to learn how to make these basic structures.</p>
<p>The subsequent sections of the Lab 3 report contain the actual assignment, where you will be prompted to make statistical investigations and to document those investigations in the report. Follow those prompts to complete the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="submissions">Submissions</h3>
<p>When you are ready to submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knit and print the HTML document. <strong>Sumbit in class</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the Lab3Report.Rmd file as follows. In the <strong>Files</strong> pane, click the checkbox for the file, then choose <code>More &gt; Export... &gt; Download</code>. <strong>Submit via Moodle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
